The facility is also responsible for final rearing of Tucannon summer steelhead released  at the hatchery and Tucannon Spring Chinook that are released from the Curl Lake Acclimation Pond each spring.  The State of Washington funds an extremely   popular \"jumbo\" Trout program, producing Rainbow between 1.5 and 2 pounds each, which are highly sought after by local anglers.

The facility began operations in 1980, as mitigation for lost natural production after dam construction. It underwent a complete three-phase renovation 2005-2013. The culvert was replaced in 2015 to improve fish-passage.<br /><br />The facility has an incubation capacity of 3.6-million eggs and a rearing capacity of two million yearlings. Normal- and late-run coho produced onsite plays an important role in freshwater recreational fisheries, as well as ocean commercial and sport, and Tribal ocean (troll and gillnet). Skookumchuck Hatchery also rears Skykomish stock coho for the South South/Squaxin Island Net Pens program (co-managed by WDFW and the Squaxin Island Tribe). Coho are also provided to various regional enhancement co-ops project sites, including the Chehalis Basin Fisheries Task Force (CBFTF), and regional education co-ops.<br /><br />In addition, Skookumchuck Hatchery spawns, incubates and rears late-winter steelhead returning to the Skookumchuck Dam. A mitigation agreement was signed in 1963 between PacifiCorp and the Washington Department of Game to compensate for the effects of dam construction and operation. The program was transferred from the South Tacoma Hatchery (now Lakewood Hatchery) in 1996. After early-rearing, 90,000 steelhead fry are transferred to the Skookumchuck Dam acclimation ponds in October, for onsite release in April. In addition, eyed-eggs are transferred to the Carlisle Lake (Onalaska High School) and yearlings to Eight Creek project sites (CBFTF) for rearing, acclimation and release.",

				     "History":"The Ringold Springs Rearing Facility (RSRF) is located in Franklin County, on the east shore of the Columbia River, 17 miles north of Pasco WA. This federally-funded facility began operations in 1962, with funding from the Federal Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (predecessor to NOAA Fisheries) under the Columbia River Fishery Development Program. The facility was built to determine if earthen rearing ponds and abundant, 58-60&deg;F spring water can be used to successfully enhance salmon and steelhead runs for fisheries in the mid-Columbia River area. For many years, the RSRF reared spring chinook, coho and steelhead.<br /><br />In 1996, two concrete raceways were constructed, per a cooperative agreement with the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to compare the survival of fall Chinook salmon reared in the earthen ponds vs. concrete raceways. Since then, 3.5-million up-river bright (URB) fall Chinook have been acclimated and released after 30-45 days of final rearing under the USACE John Day/The Dalles Mitigation Program (JDM). Recent construction (March 2014) of incubation and early-rearing facilities allows full-term rearing of locally-adapted Wells stock steelhead. Facility upgrades are required to improve rearing conditions and provide expanded egg incubation capability, which may be implemented under the proposed JDM fall Chinook production expansion at RSRF.<br /><br />This facility's production supports harvest in treaty and non-treaty, and recreational fisheries in the Columbia River Basin. In addition, URB fall Chinook contribute significantly to commercial fisheries in Alaska, Canada and Washington/Oregon troll and net fisheries.",

The facility consists of two 1/3-acre asphalt rearing ponds, and gets its water source from Coulter Creek. The site was initially built with plans for onsite incubation using pathogen free water; the incubation portion of the hatchery was never built and the supply well remains capped.<br /><br />The facility rears Deschutes River fall Chinook. Eggs are collected from the Tumwater Falls fishway trap, and transported to the Minter Creek Hatchery for incubation. The unfed fry are transferred to Coulter Creek in late-December/early-January, where they are reared and mass-marked before being transferred to the Tumwater Falls site in April/May for acclimation and release into Capitol Lake.<br /><br />Chum, coho and cutthroat trout spawn naturally in Coulter Creek. Coho return in September and Chum return in October.",

The Naches Hatchery is located five miles west of Yakima WA on the south bank of the Naches River. The facility was originally constructed in 1912, was remodeled and updated with a new hatchery building in 1973, and partially remodeled again in 1990-1991, with eight new raceways, a 1/3-acre rearing pond and a pollution abatement system. The Nelson Springs Raceway is located about four miles southeast of the Naches Hatchery, three miles upstream from the mouth of the Naches River. The facility was built in the 1970s by Yakima Chapter of the NW Steelhead and Salmon Council of Trout Unlimited volunteers to rear summer steelhead. The steelhead program ended in 1988, and the Washington Department of Game took over operation, as a satellite facility to the main hatchery, to rear resident rainbow trout. NSR is currently owned by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). The NSR site and water source is also used by the Yakama Nation to acclimate/release Y/KFP summer Chinook salmon in portable aluminum raceways, which are adjacent to the main 100' x 10' raceway that WDFW uses for rainbow trout production.<br /><br />The hatchery complex produces rainbow, cutthroat, kokanee and golden trout. These two facilities, staffed by two hatchery specialists, produce 85% of the 11 to13 inch \"standard catchable\" rainbow trout stocked in lowland Yakima, Kittitas, and Benton county lowland lakes. Naches Hatchery produces 90,000 catchables and NSR produces 15,000 catchables, 2,000 half-pound jumbos, and 5,000 one-pound jumbos, or about 20% of the combined production. If larger 1/2-pound and 1-pound \"jumbo\" rainbow trout are included, these two facilities produce 93.5% of all catchable trout stocked in the three counties.

The hatchery produces cutthroat, eastern brook, lowland lake rainbow, high lake rainbow, golden trout and winter steelhead.  Spring and summer stocking of these fish provide excellent recreational opportunities for the fishing enthusiast whether they trek into the alpine lakes or fish lowland lakes, streams or beaver ponds.  Fall chinook adults entering Tokul Creek are also trapped and transported upstream to allow access to spawning grounds.",

The facility is owned and maintained by WDFW, and is located at river mile 1 on Weaver Creek, tributary to the lower Skokomish River. The hatchery fall chum production was developed to augment harvest opportunities and provide partial mitigation for reduced natural production in the Skokomish system, primarily caused by hydroelectric development on the NF Skokomish River. An incubation building was added and some pond modifications were made in 1994. The site consists of an in-stream rearing pond, three raceways, fiberglass circular ponds, and an asphalt-bottom combination adult holding/rearing pond.<br /><br />The facility was targeted for closure due to budget cuts in 2010. WDFW signed a five-year partnership with Purse Seine Vessel Owners Association (PSVOA) to fund continuing operations for the chum program. The contract ended in 2015, and was extended for one year, through June 2016.<br /><br />From 2007 through 2013, the facility supported the NOAA-funded Hood Canal Winter Steelhead Supplementation Project. Eyed embryos were collected from redds produced by natural spawners in the SF Skokomish River. The eggs were incubated and reared at McKernan Hatchery, then released as yearlings directly into their in the lower reaches of natal streams without acclimation in late-April/early-May. The program was discontinued in 2014.",
